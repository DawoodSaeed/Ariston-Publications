The sensor, fabricated through electropolymerization of aniline on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and modified with SWCNTs, exhibited enhanced electron transfer kinetics, increased surface area, and improved sensitivity. Under optimized conditions (pH 7.0, 1.0% SWCNT solution), the sensor demonstrated linear detection ranges of 500–1000 µM for LD and 100–500 µM for BS, with detection limits of 183.2 µM and 44.5 µM, respectively. Notably, ascorbic acid interference was minimized, ensuring selectivity. Validation studies using pharmaceutical tablets and human urine samples confirmed high accuracy and reliability. The rapid response, cost-effectiveness, and potential for miniaturization make this sensor a valuable alternative for real-time pharmaceutical and clinical monitoring of LD and BS.",

The methodology’s scalability and mild conditions facilitate the labeling of peptides, antibodies, and other targeting vectors, offering a versatile tool for diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceutical development in oncology and neurology.",
              "summary": "This work developed a copper-free 18F-labeling strategy using strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) between dibenzocyclooctyne acid (DIBAC) and [18F]PEG-azide. The synthesis achieved high radiochemical yields (92%) and specific activity (254.69 GBq/µmol) within 90 minutes. Optimization studies demonstrated efficient labeling with substoichiometric DIBAC (0.2 mg). The method eliminates copper catalysts, ensuring biocompatibility, and offers rapid, chemoselective conjugation under mild conditions, making it suitable for PET tracer development.",

              "significance": "This study underscores the efficacy of CNT-intercalated Moringa oleifera leaf powder (MOLP) as a sustainable and cost-effective adsorbent for wastewater treatment. By demonstrating superior adsorption of methylene blue dye, it provides an eco-friendly alternative to conventional adsorbents like activated carbon. The synergistic role of CNTs in enhancing surface properties and functional group interactions positions this bio-composite as a viable solution for addressing dye pollution, particularly in resource-limited settings, contributing significantly to environmental sustainability.",
              "summary": "The study evaluates the adsorption capacity of methylene blue (MB) dye using a bio-composite of CNT-functionalized Moringa oleifera leaf powder (MOLP). Systematic optimization of adsorption parameters, including pH, dye concentration, temperature, and contact time, revealed the superior efficiency of CNT-MOLP compared to pristine MOLP. Characterization via SEM and FT-IR confirmed enhanced porosity and functional groups essential for dye binding. This work establishes CNT-MOLP as a sustainable, cost-effective adsorbent for industrial wastewater treatment applications.",

The findings highlight the advantages of nanostructured MnO₂ in enhancing charge storage, ion diffusion, and electrochemical stability. The results contribute to the development of efficient and scalable energy storage solutions, addressing the growing demand for sustainable supercapacitor technologies.",
              "summary": "MnO₂ thin films were successfully electrodeposited onto stainless steel substrates, forming binder-free nanostructured electrodes for supercapacitor applications. Structural characterization confirmed the formation of amorphous birnessite δ-MnO₂, with XRD, FTIR, and XPS analyses validating its composition and bonding states. The electrochemical performance, evaluated through CV and GCD, revealed a high specific capacitance of 439 F g⁻¹, along with excellent energy and power densities. The study underscores the advantages of electrodeposited MnO₂, including its uniform morphology, efficient charge storage, and environmental sustainability. Future research should focus on optimizing deposition conditions, incorporating MnO₂ composites, and assessing long-term cycling stability to further enhance its supercapacitor performance.",

Using Holstein-Primakoff transformations and Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the system’s mean field solution shows z₂-symmetry breaking at the transition point.

By demonstrating z₂-symmetry breaking and deriving an effective temperature independent of dissipation rate and bath cutoff frequency, the study provides insights into non-equilibrium quantum phenomena. The findings, including modified dissipative spectra due to fluctuations, highlight the potential for novel physical behaviors in quantum systems, contributing to the understanding of driven-dissipative systems and their emergent thermal characteristics.",
